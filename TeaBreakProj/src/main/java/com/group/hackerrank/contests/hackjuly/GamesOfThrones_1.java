 * 
 * King Robert has 7 kingdoms under his rule. He gets to know from Raven that
 * the Dothraki are to wage a war against him soon. But, he knows the Dothraki
 * need to cross the narrow river to enter his dynasty. There is only one bridge
 * that connects both sides of the river which is sealed by a huge door.
 *
 *
 *
 * The king wants to lock the door so that the Dothraki canâ€™t enter. But, to
 * lock the door you need a key that is a palindrome of an anagram of a certain
 * string.
 *
 * The king has a list of words. For each given word, can you help the king in
 * figuring out if any anagram of it can be a palindrome or not?.
 *
 * Input Format A single line which will contain the input string
 *
 * Constraints 1<=length of string <= 10^5 Each character of the string is a
 * lowercase english alphabet.
 *
 * Output Format A single line containing YES/NO in capital letter of english
 * alphabet.
 *
 * Sample Input : 01
 *
 * aaabbbb Sample Output : 01
 *
 * YES Explanation One of the permutations of the given string which is a
 * palindrome is bbaaabb. * Sample Input : 02
 *
 * cdefghmnopqrstuvw Sample Output : 02
 *
 * NO Explanation You can verify that no permutation of the given string can be
 * a palindrome. Sample Input : 03
 *
 * cdcdcdcdeeeef
 *
 * Sample Output : 03
 *
 * YES Explanation One of the permutations of the given string which is a
 * palindrome is ddcceefeeccdd .
